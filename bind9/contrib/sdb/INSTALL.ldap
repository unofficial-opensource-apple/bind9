This is the INSTALL file for 0.4. See
http://www.venaas.no/ldap/bind-sdb/ for updates or other information.

BUILDING

You need the source for BIND 9.1.0 or newer (for zone transfers you
will need at least 9.1.1rc3 due to a bug). Basically you need to follow
the instructions in doc/misc/sdb, if my instructions doesn't make sense,
please have a look at that as well.

Copy ldapdb.c to bin/named and ldapdb.h to bin/named/include in the
source tree.

Next alter bin/named/Makefile.in. Add ldapdb.@O@ to DBDRIVER_OBJS and
ldapdb.c to DBDRIVER_SRCS. You also need to add something like
-I/usr/local/include to DBDRIVER_INCLUDES and
-L/usr/local/lib -lldap -llber -lresolv to DBDRIVER_LIBS
depending on what LDAP library you have and where you installed it.

Finally you need to edit bin/named/main.c. Below where it says
"#include "xxdb.h"", add the line "#include <ldapdb.h>". Below where
it says "xxdb_init();" add the line "ldapdb_init();", and finally
below where it says "xxdb_clear();", add "ldapdb_clear();".

Now you should hopefully be able to build it.


CONFIGURING

Before you do any configuring of LDAP stuff, please try to configure
and start bind as usual to see if things work.

To do anything useful, you need to store a zone in some LDAP server.
From this release on, you must use a schema called dNSZone. Note that
it relies on some attribute definitions in the Cosine schema, so that
must be included as well. The Cosine schema probably comes with your
LDAP server. You can find dNSZone and further details on how to store
the data in your LDAP server at
http://www.venaas.no/ldap/bind-sdb/

For an example, have a look at my venaas.com zone. Try a subtree search
for objectClass=* at
ldap ldap://129.241.20.67/dc=venaas,dc=com,o=DNS,dc=venaas,dc=no

To use it with BIND, I've added the following to named.conf:
zone "venaas.com" {
        type master;
        database "ldap ldap://129.241.20.67/dc=venaas,dc=com,o=DNS,dc=venaas,dc=no 172800";
};

When doing lookups BIND will do a sub-tree search below the base in the
URL. The number 172800 is the TTL which will be used for all entries that
haven't got the dNSTTL attribute.
